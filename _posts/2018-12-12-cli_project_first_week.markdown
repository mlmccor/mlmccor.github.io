The idea of starting my first solo project has induced a lot of anxiety for me. In college, I struggled with procrastination with major essays and projects because I never really knew (or trusted that I knew) how to start. In Avi Flaumbaum's walkthrough for starting the project, I found those nestled feelings creeping back to life. Here are a couple tips I've discovered that really helped me get over this type of anxiety:

### Create the Complete Image of Your Project

Before you start anything with the code, pull out a notebook and start walking through your entire program on paper. Think about everything: the format of the text on the screen, the type of input you want from the user, even the way you would like to navigate back to the opening menu. In my other job, I make my private trumpet students remember one phrase:

> The clearer the image in your mind, the less opportunity you have for mistakes.

While the specifics might be different, the idea is just as helpful. If you constantly write with the image of how the final product will look, your coding will always have the right focus and you won't have to backtrack nearly as much. I also found that, when I had a clear idea of how my finished program would look, my organization of methods became much clearer. One thing I didn't understand while going through the Music CLI and the Student Scraper Labs was why some methods went to specific classes, but not others. With this project, the responsibilities of each class make perfect sense because of my clear understanding of its functionality. 

### Don't worry about the order, just work

Another thing that made it hard to start was stressing out about the order in which to do the work. As I'm now a good chunk of the way toward a working prototype, I can tell you all of that worry was just wasted time. What I was experiencing was what performers know as "paralysis analysis."  

Some of you reading are probably starting to see an issue with this already, and yes, the order of this project isn't entirely interchangeable. Running Bundler has to come first, to get the file structure, but I would argue that after that, really anything is fair game, as long as you follow my first tip. 

What got me started figuring out the order I wanted to start working was thinking about what would be the easiest to test, using "pry" or otherwise. I started in the order Avi uses in the walkthrough, but after I started the CLI class, all I could think about was how I was going to implement my Scraper, so I switched gears. This is a notable switch from the order we've been doing all of our work in the labs, and that's okay. The truth is, no one is going to follow the same path through this project. Everyone has different ways of thinking, and everyone has a different project outline. 

### Don't be afraid to walk away for a bit

Just like in our labs, you're going to find a hurdle that you can't overcome yet, and no amount of "pry"-ing will give you the answer. That's when I like to get up, walk around, exercise, do a household chore, get a snack, or make a cup of coffee or tea. This will give your brain a rest, and allow it to focus better the next time you start coding. 

Don't come back to work for at least 15-30 minutes, or however long it takes to forget the code you just wrote. Then, when you come back, you'll start to look at your code in a new light. Have you ever gone through your old social media posts, or read an old essay you did for school years after you wrote it? You start to look at it differently, maybe notice grammatical mistakes or how disorganized your thoughts are. On a much smaller scale, this happens when you take a break anytime you hit a wall in your work.

Unfortunately, our brains are not a pro football player at a buffet - they can't keep shoving knowledge with the hopes of actually retaining it. We need time to process the knowledge fully, which means time to rest. If I had a nickel for every time I had a problem that I forced myself to work on for an hour with no results, took a short break, came back to work and found the solution within a minute of returning to work, I would be independently wealthy. This project is going to need a lot of work hours, but be sure to give yourself plenty of breaks to give yourself fresh views of your code.

I've been reminding myself of these tips constantly this week. I wish you all good luck on your projects, and hope these tips help you for the rest of the course!
