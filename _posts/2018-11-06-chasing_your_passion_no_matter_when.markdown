I probably owe my love of computers to my dad. As long as I can remember, he was always super interested in computers. I still remember playing computer on his old Amiga when I was really young. I was around 12 when he gave me my first computer (a hand-me-down desktop of his), and that was the time that I began getting curious about more than just computer games, but the operating system itself, which in my case was Windows. 

When I was ready to graduate high school, I had to decide whether to major in computer science or another passion of mine, playing the trumpet. Eventually the trumpet won out.

Fast forward two degrees and a few years later and I'm living my dream of being a freelance trumpet player and teaching private trumpet lessons to kids. The work itself has been very rewarding, but this life came with its own drawbacks. Many orchestras in this country don't have the budget to hire full-time musicians; most mid to low level orchestras contract out their musicians, paying on a per-service basis. Since these same orchestras only have concerts about once a month, the end result for me is a paycheck not nearly enough to be considered a living.

I've auditioned all over the country to be a full-time member of orchestras that paid living wages, but the growing number of freelance musicians like myself make the competition very stiff. Every year, hundreds of trumpet players graduate from universities all over the country, but the number of trumpet jobs that pay a livable wage is less than 100, and out of those orchestras, maybe 12 will have openings any given year. This doesn't even account for the fact that orchestras all over the country are finding it difficult to adapt to changing audiences and are making deep pay cuts, including some of those full-time orchestras. 

With the current climate of orchestras, I struggled to find a way to adapt to this changing business. It was around this time that I began thinking about website design as a possible second freelance job. I started watching introductory Javascript videos from the internet, and the more I learned, the more intrigued I became. After researching more career opportunities with this, I stumbled upon The Flatiron School's Bootcamp Prep course, where I actually started coding myself.

Coding has been satisfying to me in ways that music has been, but also in some ways music never will be. Like performing music, coding is more than just memorizing facts and knowledge that someone discovered, but gaining skills so that they can applied to real world situations. Just like you need to know the fingerings of the notes of the trumpet so that you don't waste time writing them in, you need to know how to navigate the functions of a programming language in order to use it to solve a problem. Unlike performing music, however, coding is mostly a challenge for your own logical thinking. Whenever I'm coding I feel like I'm solving logic puzzles with different rules every time, at least in this stage in my learning. I also enjoy that there's a sense of objectivity about coding that you can't get in music. I've learned early on that there is no such thing as a perfect performance, and many times, what some musicians think is amazing, other musicians will believe is terrible. In programming, your code either works in all cases or it doesn't.

I'm glad that I've been able to reawaken and chase this long forgotten passion of mine after all this time. I don't know yet what my programming career aspirations are, or what kind of programming jobs I would be interested working on. I don't think I'm ready to leave playing the trumpet behind forever, but luckily with the nature of that job, I don't think I'll have to. With this new chapter in my life beginning, I know that the possibilities are endless and that I'll be that much closer to a career that is both livable and satisfying.
